# YAML Configuration with Deep Merge

## Context and Problem Statement

ENV vars in markdown instructions ([CORE-0008](CORE-0008 Variables in Markdown Instructions and Templates.md)) need a source. Each module has configurable values — paths, feature flags, skill rosters — that differ between default and user-specific setups. The configuration system must support committed defaults, user overrides, and ENV var export without requiring users to manage shell profiles.

## Decision Drivers

- Defaults must be committed and version-controlled — the module works out of the box
- User overrides must be gitignored — personal paths and preferences don't pollute the repo
- Override granularity must be per-field, not per-file — users change one path, not copy the entire config
- ENV variable export must be automatic — general-purpose tools like `yq` can read individual values, but exporting an entire config subtree as prefixed ENV vars requires a multi-step pipeline

## Considered Options

1. **Flat ENV files** — `.env` with `KEY=VALUE` pairs, no nesting, no merge, no defaults mechanism
2. **JSON config** — structured, mergeable, but painful to author by hand and no comment support
3. **YAML with deep merge** — `defaults.yaml` (committed) merged with `config.yaml` (gitignored), recursive merge so users override only the fields they need

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **YAML with deep merge**. Each module ships `defaults.yaml` with the full schema and sensible defaults. Users create `config.yaml` (gitignored) with only the fields they want to override. The config loading exports the merged result as ENV vars with a configurable prefix.

### Consequences

- [+] Module works out of the box with zero user configuration
- [+] Users override one field without knowing the full schema
- [+] Config loading bridges config to ENV vars consumed by skills and shell commands
- [-] Deep merge semantics can be surprising — array replacement vs append, null vs missing
